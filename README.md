## Lessons Learned

Learning Experience: I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, how to create a responsive design, and the importance of a well-structured layout and user-friendly interface.

Challenges Faced: Maintaining design consistency, adapting to responsive design, implementing JavaScript features, and debugging were challenging. I overcame them by using CSS stylesheets, learning media queries, referring to online tutorials, and practicing debugging techniques.

This project enhanced my web development skills and boosted my confidence for future projects.
